# ðŸ“š Problems in DSA

A consolidated collection of solved Data Structures and Algorithms problems from various topics and coding platforms. This repository is a unified version of my earlier topic-wise repositories, organized neatly into folders for better maintainability and reference.

## ðŸ§  What's Inside

Each folder contains problems based on specific DSA topics or categories. Inside each topic folder, you'll find:

- âœ… Problem statements
- ðŸ’¡ Solution code (with proper naming conventions)
- ðŸ“„ Explanations where required (inline or separate markdown files)
